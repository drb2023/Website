                            Welcome to my personal website v2.0!

                            I'm a person who is happiest in the Rocky Mountains. I love hunting, fishing, and camping. My favorite getaway spot is Taylor Park, CO. It's a blast exploring mountain trails during the day and camping under the stars at night. There is something special about getting away from civilization every once in a while.

                            <br/>
                            I have decided to shift gears, leaving a long career in the automotive electronics world to re-train and start a new career in the tech industry. Please feel free to connect with me via the LinkedIn button below.
